						&nbsp &nbsp Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, 
host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your 
content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in 
this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if 
you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove 
content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content 
submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.
<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, 
tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected 
to your Google Account (such as +1â€™s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. 
We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your 
name and photo do not appear in an ad.

&nbsp &nbsp You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you 
submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.
